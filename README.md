# el-em
A browser based Emulator for [Microsoft Expression Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/workflow-definition-language-functions-reference#uriComponentToBinary) - used in Power Automate, Logic Apps and Azure Data Factory.

The intent of the emulator is for new users to quickly build and try Expression Language statements without having to run their flow/app/pipeline first.

The emulator requires nothing server side and can be hosted statically: for example at [nonodename.com](https://nonodename.com/el)

## Running locally

Fire up a web server of your preference with root in the `/code` directory. Python works well: `python3 -M http.server`
